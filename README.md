# Tic Tac Toe Game in C

## Overview
This is a simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe game developed in C. The game is designed to be played in the console and supports two players. It features a user-friendly interface for entering player names, choosing symbols (X or O), and tracking scores. This project helped me enhance my C programming skills and provided insights into game development.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Start a new game, enter player names, choose symbols, and enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of each player's wins and view the scores anytime.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear and straightforward prompts guide the players through the game setup and gameplay.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**:
   - Run the program.
   - Type `1` to start a new game.
   - Enter the first player's name.
   - Enter the second player's name.
   - Each player chooses their symbol (X or O).
   - The game begins and players take turns entering their moves.

2. **View Scores**:
   - After the game ends, type `2` to view the scores.
   - The score tracking feature displays the number of wins for each player.

## Development Highlights
- **Programming Language**: C
- **User Input Handling**: Ensured smooth and error-free input for player names and symbols.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developed efficient algorithms to check for win conditions and handle game flow.
- **Score Tracking**: Implemented a feature to track and display players' scores.

## Learning Outcomes
This project was a valuable learning experience that helped me:
- Enhance my understanding of C programming.
- Improve my skills in handling user input and implementing game logic.
- Learn about data persistence within a program for score tracking.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
- Include more detailed statistics, such as the number of draws and longest winning streaks.
